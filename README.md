# MSc-Project_Gardening-Support-Web-Application-
Growing vegetables within home gardens is becoming a popular hobby for
many people, with raised beds being used to grow items such as potatoes,
leeks, lettuce, radishes, and peas. A challenge exists in that the maintenance
and upkeep of these spaces requires an understanding of crop yield, the
best technique and resources required for growing crops and also an
understanding of the weather and environmental conditions suitable for
growing crops.
The purpose of this project is to
investigate this issue and to develop a
web-based system to manage the
organisation and maintenance
associated with maintaining a healthy
garden.
Tools Used â€“ HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
phpMyAdmin (localhost), MySQL,
Visual Studio Code.
